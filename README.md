# Model-based Validation of Autonomous Driving Using WPILib

## Abstract

We will implement autonomous driving using WPILib 2020, then simulate it against
a realistic mathematical model of FRC team 3512's 2020 robot.

This is an end-to-end presentation on autonomous driving for differential drive
and skid steer robots using the tools available in WPILib 2020. First, it will
give an overview of the disciplines required like localization (knowing where
you are), motion planning (planning a way to get where you want to go), and
control (actually getting there). Then, these concepts will be implemented and
simulated against a realistic mathematical model of FRC team 3512's 2020 robot.

## Lay out traj gen presentation

Yes. I'll work on an end-to-end presentation for trajectory tracking. It'll give an overview of the different aspects required like odometry (knowing where you are relative to where you want to go), trajectory generation (planning a way to get there), and control (actually getting there). I can modify my FRC team's drivetrain sim backend for a demo, since I don't have access to a robot and that model proved very accurate.

I haven't given live lectures in a while, so my time estimation skills are rusty. Showing just plugging the library pieces together would be about half an hour of content, if I prepare all the steps I need to reduce mistakes on-the-fly. It might feel a bit rushed, but I won't know until I have the presentation together. Hour timeslot, perhaps? I can give you a better estimate later today.
